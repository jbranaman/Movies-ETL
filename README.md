## Overview of Project
As part of a hackathon, a pipeline of data is being taken from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, being combined and saved into a SQL database. This is following an ETL process: **extracting** the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, **transforming** the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and **loading** the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
